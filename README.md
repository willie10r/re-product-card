##summery<br/>
This was one of my first attemps at making a react base site so I wanted to keep it simple.

##processes and tools used<br/>
*html<br/>
*css<br/>
*sass/scss<br/>
*git

##continued development<br/>
I made this app to be as simple as possible with react so I have no plans on further development.
